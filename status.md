## August 2018

The majority of the 5e content has been uploaded to github. Doing
so required non-trivial translation from **heavily** marked-up LaTex
to markdown, so there is a chance errors have been introduced. The
initial markdown is also fairly primitive.

This initial content excludes sidebars, most of the exercises, and all
of the book's front- and back-matter. We have permission to open
source those exercises that come with solutions, but doing so is still
pending.
